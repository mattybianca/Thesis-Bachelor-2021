# Optimisation of companies’ and investors’ choices in thecryptoasset market and the stock market.

**Research Question:** Is it possible to determine, analysing historical data, what a company shouldchoose, between raising capital in a traditional way, such as with an IPO, and raisingcapital in the cryptoassets market? Furthermore, is it was possible to optimise the investors’ portfolio with risky assets from both IPOs and cryptoassets market?

This repository contains all the files I used during the research. It contains both spreadsheets (xlsx and csv extensions) in the folder 'Excel files' and jupyter notebooks in the folder 'Notebooks'.
